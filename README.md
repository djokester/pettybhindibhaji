# Petty Bhindi Bhaji: Automated Message Variations and Reminders

Petty Bhindi Bhaji is a Hindi wordplay for the words Petty, Vindictive and Vengeful. Bhindi Bhaji means Okra Fry in Hindi and sound phonetically similar to the starting of Vidnictive and Vengeful. Eh, the connection might be thin.

Petty Bhindi Bhaji is a Streamlit app that lets you record messages, use an LLM to create variations based on your use case, and send these variations to your email at regular intervals. Use cases include storing your favorite motivational quotes and setting prompts to generate variations of these quotes, allowing you to receive a unique, uplifting message every morning to start your day. I use it to keep track of my grudges, hence the name and the long deep dive into its etymology.

This has as an option for generating variations using LLMs. Currently this just supports groq. I will add OpenAI support later if I feel less lazy in the future.
This currently is only configured for GMail. Why you would have some other email provider is beyond me. You would need to generate an App Password for this as most of us have 2FA enabled. For those who don’t, well, let’s just say you like to live dangerously! Anyway to set your app password you need to visit [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) with the email you want to send this from.
